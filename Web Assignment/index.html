            <h3>A Carnivore meaning "Meat Eater" is an animal whose food and energy requirements derive solely from
                animal tissue or meat, whether through hunting or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh
                for their nutrient requirements are called carnivores.</h3>

            <h3>Herbivores depend on plants for their survival. A herbivore is an organism that mostly feeds on plants.
                They range in size from tiny insects to large elephants. Herbivores are
                a major part of the food web, a description of which organisms eat other organisms in the wild.</h3>

            <h2>OMNIVORES</h2>
            <h3>An omnivore is an animal that has the ability to eat and survive on both plant and animal matter.
                Obtaining energy and nutrients from both, omnivores digest carbohydrates, protein,
                fat, and fiber, and metabolize the nutrients and energy of the sources absorbed.</h3>
